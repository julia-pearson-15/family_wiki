polymorphic associations -- two types of comments

erb partials


questions:

in models/
general question - join tables make themselves? Must I seed them?

article.rb :
[2] can I just do  -  has_many :sections :comments




in views/

layout.erb : 
[1] this will be the changing html etc. for dynamic section of page?



in public/

index.html :
general: do I need an yeild here to get to layout?

[1] this will be the html etc. for whole page (skeleton)?



in db/

config.rb
[6] why do I need to say db/when we're already in db?
